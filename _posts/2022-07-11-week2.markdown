Hi all!

## For last week 
I am finally success building gr-web from source code.
(yeah, last week there existed a weird issue, currently, I running well on chrome but poorly on firefox), 
and I will watch it later!

Besides, I am playing a simple flow graph with grc (gnuradio-companion).
It's cool running cos the noise on the grc, and watching the rise and down.

I have to say I cannot get the point with running python in index.html last week, 
and luckily Marc helped me figure it out that the py file will call grc function ðŸ˜Š

## For this week
I will try to measure the performance on `volk` with origin grc script, pure python call lib, and wasm(if successful)

The step I plan to achieve:
  1. choose the origin grc python script as test case A
  2. choose the wasm_no_simd volk script as test case B
  3. (if fortunate) choose the wasm_simd volk script as test case C
  4. using chrome dev-tools to benchmark
Thanks for your reading!
