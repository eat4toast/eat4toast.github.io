Hi, all!

It's the first official blog I post there about this summer coding task.

It's hard to believe the gap between our first meeting and today is almost 3 weeks.

What stalled me was building gr-web from the source.

And honestly, it really takes time and consumes patience.

I really appreciate [Marc](https://github.com/marcnewlin/gnuradio-web), He gives me a lot of help without words.

Back to gr-web, What I had done is successfully build the gr-web.

For the next plan(these days):

* Consider completing a naive test flamework for running unit tests for volk python code.
* Consider a method to porting volk kernel with simd accelerate under wasm.

Currently, the main module is built to the static library and called by python with pybind11. Focus on volk this lib, the CPP code uses the generic functions under many top-level modules, so I will create a simple module called volk_test to run different python codes.

*For the attractive part:*

I wonder if we can directly use NumPy to implement those simd kernels.
