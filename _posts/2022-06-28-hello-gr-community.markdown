Hi, all
This blog keeps the official/formal updates/progress on [GSoC porting SIMD-heavy code (eg. volk, fftw3, etc) to use the Wasm-supported set of intrinsics](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/Zd3Mr5G5).


For this project, we will enable more accelerated  SIMD code into gr-web with webassembly(wasm), which maybe enable gnu-radio more popular/educatable through browser


If everything goes well, later we will focus on making gr-web more extensible.
