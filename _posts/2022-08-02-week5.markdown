Hi, everyone!

Yeah, I know this post is delayed one day(expected yesterday), since yesterday with [@haakov](https://github.com/haakov)'s help, I get more progress.

## progress
it maybe sounds amusing, but I finally successfully run the flow graph again. posted image: ![here](https://s1.328888.xyz/2022/08/02/FdOF5.jpg)

(seems related to the commit lost in rebasing, **I do not know why, but it works haha**).

And luckily, I found out in nearly 3 weeks ago why my chrome can run flow-graph but firefox fails running the same server.py.

It causes by cookies, after cleaning all loaded cookies and data, it plays normally.

## todo
well, it's time to hurry up.
I intend to do 2 things in parallel:

1. building volk through wasm-simd
2. enable edit the module in flow graph on gr-web


The first thing is already delayed many weeks. I plan to modify the emscripten compile option and try transplanting the simd.


The second thing that is really important not only does current the gr-web not support the edition module ability but it will enable more extensible.


It's a bit fuzzy:
find the accurate code, build to a static library, and call by python through pybind.



### That's all.
By the way, If you want to build gr-web locally, recommend to using this branch:
